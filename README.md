## Game Title: Chamber of Mysteries

The motto of the game is to solve the whole game in the least amount of time and collect all of the wands.
The Chamber of Mysteries is a game that follows a character in their journey to collect 5 wands that the evil Woldebort has hidden around the map to break the curse that he has placed on Bogvolts. The character will have to solve various puzzles, riddles and mini games to collect the wands. The game will be a first person adventure, puzzle 3-D game that is influenced by games like Hogwarts Legacy, Temple Run, Squid Games, Memory matcher games, Stardew Valley, etc... Each of the puzzles,riddles and mini games will be in their own rooms that will have their own unique style and influence and will contain different play style elements like darkening the room periodically, moving around the puzzles based on user inputs, etc... As well after a level/room is solved then the player will be rewarded with a wand that will help them to break the curse. If the player fails a level then they may be sent back to the first level depending on which level they are at. The game will start at a Title screen where the player can pick between playing, viewing the leaderboard, changing settings and seeing the about us.
